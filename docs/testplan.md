## Manual Testing Plan

Below are the items that should be manually tested with each release of Teleport.
These tests should be run on both a fresh install of the version to be released
as well as an upgrade of the previous version of Teleport.

- [ ] Adding nodes to a cluster

- [ ] Session Recording
  - [ ] Session recording can be disabled
  - [ ] Sessions can be recorded at the node
    - [ ] Sessions in remote clusters are recorded in remote clusters
  - [ ] Sessions can be recorded at the proxy
    - [ ] Sessions on remote clusters are recorded in the local cluster
    - [ ] Enable/disable host key checking.

- [ ] Audit Log
  - [ ] Failed login attempts are recorded

    - [ ] Server ID is the ID of the node in regular mode
    - [ ] Server ID is randomly generated for proxy node
  - [ ] Exec commands are recorded
  - [ ] `scp` commands are recorded
  - [ ] Subsystem results are recorded

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using `tsh`

   These commands should ideally be tested for recording and non-recording modes as they are implemented in a different ways.

  - [ ] tsh ssh -L \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -L \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ls
  - [ ] tsh clusters

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using `ssh`
   Make sure to test both recording and regular proxy modes.

### Teleport with EKS/GKE

* [ ] Deploy Teleport on a single EKS cluster
* [ ] Deploy Teleport on two EKS clusters and connect them via trusted cluster feature
* [ ] Deploy Teleport Proxy outside of GKE cluster fronting connections to it (this feature is not yet supported for EKS)

### Teleport with multiple Kubernetes clusters

Note: you can use GKE or EKS or minikube to run Kubernetes clusters.
Minikube is the only caveat - it's not reachable publicly so don't run a proxy there.

* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy/kubernetes_service outside of a Kubernetes cluster, using a kubeconfig
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy/kubernetes_service inside of a Kubernetes cluster
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy_service outside of the Kubernetes cluster and kubernetes_service inside of a Kubernetes cluster, connected over a reverse tunnel
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy a second kubernetes_service inside of another Kubernetes cluster, connected over a reverse tunnel
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has both clusters
  * [ ] Switch to a second cluster using `tsh kube login`
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh` on the new cluster
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy/kubernetes_service outside of a Kubernetes cluster, using a kubeconfig with multiple clusters in it
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has all clusters

### Teleport with FIPS mode

* [ ] Perform trusted clusters, Web and SSH sanity check with all teleport components deployed in FIPS mode.

### Migrations

* [ ] Migrate trusted clusters from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on main cluster, then rest of the servers on main cluster
        SSH should work for both main and old clusters
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on remote cluster, then rest of the remote cluster
       SSH should work

### Command Templates

When interacting with a cluster, the following command templates are useful:

#### OpenSSH

```
# when connecting to the recording proxy, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` is required.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# the above command only forwards the agent to the proxy, to forward the agent
# to the target node, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` needs to be passed twice.
ssh -o "ForwardAgent yes" \
  -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# when connecting to a remote cluster using OpenSSH, the subsystem request is
# updated with the name of the remote cluster.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p@foo.com" \
  node.foo.com
```

#### Teleport

```
# when connecting to a OpenSSH node, remember `-p 22` needs to be passed.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -p 22 node.example.com

# an agent can be forwarded to the target node with `-A`
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -A -p 22 node.example.com

# the --cluster flag is used to connect to a node in a remote cluster.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh --cluster=foo.com -p 22 node.foo.com
```

tsh bench --duration=4h user@teleport-monster-6757d7b487-x226b ls
tsh bench -i --duration=4h user@teleport-monster-6757d7b487-x226b ps uax
